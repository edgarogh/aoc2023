# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎄
 
_Stupid me thinks he won't give up 3 days in from boredom like every year since he's known about AoC. At least I'm perseverant, that's a quality I guess._

## 🚷 Rules

This year, like 2 years ago, I try a different language/environment every day. Here are my exact rules:

  * Different programming language every day
    * I'm a bit lax on the definition of "language": if I use the same language but in a radically untraditional way that feels novel and creative enough, it's valid
  * I have 6 Rust jokers (¼ of the days) because I don't wanna burn myself out
    * The second star of a day can always be earned via Rust whatsoever
    * I can use Rust in a non-joker way any day like any other language, which adds up to 7 Rust days hehe
  * First and second star of a day may be in different languages. The second star's language doesn't count towards "used" languages and may be used again later (or before)
  * I have to try to be creative, but I don't want to spend 4h a day over-engineering all solutions either
  * The input file may be preprocessed any way I want with any language I want without counting towards used languages, should the novelty of my solution's implementation warrant such processing. For instance, if I implement a solution within a video game that doesn't have file reading abilities, I may minimally pre-process the file just enough, so it is usable in the game.

## 📆 Solutions

  * 1st
    * Star 1: Shenzhen I/O
    * Star 2: Rust
  * 2nd: Haskell (both stars) (first time doing Haskell)
  * 4th: Rust (Joker 1/6)
  * 5th
    * Star 1: JavaScript + Deno
  * 6th: Typst

## ▶️ Running

All input.txt files should be downloaded in `/inputs` (c.f. [inputs/README.md](inputs/README.md)).

All solutions may expect to be run with this repo's root as their working directory.

I'll eventually set up a `justfile` to run some of the solutions, but not every one of them can be run automatically (e.g. solution 1-1 is implemented in the Shenzhen I/O videogame, which is paid, may require being launched through steam and doesn't support CLI arguments anyway).

Solutions that aren't trivial to run may be accompanied by their own README.
